# pygmy

<b>[This program is in active development and is currently highly unstable.]</b>

Pygmy is a tree viewer for large trees (1 million taxa) and associated metadata. It aims to be a cross-platform replacement for ARB that allows large trees to be explored using modern visualization and navigation techniques.
