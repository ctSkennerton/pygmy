# pygmy

**[This program is in active development and many features are missing.]**

Pygmy is a tree viewer for large trees (1 million taxa) and associated
metadata. It aims to be a cross-platform replacement for ARB that
allows large trees to be explored using modern visualization and
navigation techniques.

## Install

There are currently no released versions, however the source code
can be downloaded from [github](https://github.com/ctSkennerton/pygmy).
There are currently three external dependencies which must be
installed prior to compiling Pygmy:

* [freetype](http://www.freetype.org/)  2.3.9: software library to render fonts.
* [ftgl](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ftgl/) 2.1.3-rc5: library that uses Freetype2 to simplify rendering fonts in OpenGL applications.
* [Qt](http://qt.io) 5.4
